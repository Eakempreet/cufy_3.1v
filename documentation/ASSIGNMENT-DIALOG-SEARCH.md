  return false
}
```

#### State Management:
```typescript
const [assignDialogSearchTerm, setAssignDialogSearchTerm] = useState('')

// Clear search when opening dialog

  setAssignDialogSearchTerm('') // Fresh start for each assignment
  // ... other logic

- **Try multiple search terms** if first attempt returns few results
- **Search bio content** for personality-based matching
- **Clear search between assignments** for fresh perspective

#### Common Search Patterns:
- **Regional**: Search by city or university names
