## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Added to users table:
- subscription_type VARCHAR(50)
- subscription_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'inactive'
- payment_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE  
- payment_proof_url TEXT

-- New tables:
- payments (id, user_id, amount, status, etc.)
- user_rounds (id, user_id, selected_user_id, round_number)
```

### User Flow
1. **Onboarding** → Profile completion check → Redirect if complete
2. **Subscription Selection** → Choose plan → Save to database
3. **Payment Page** → Upload proof → Status tracking
4. **Admin Confirmation** → Review proof → Confirm payment
5. **Dashboard Access** → Payment status indicator → Full features

### Security & Validation
- All APIs require proper authentication
- Admin features restricted to `cufy.online@gmail.com`
- File upload validation and automatic cleanup
- Profile completion verification on all protected routes
